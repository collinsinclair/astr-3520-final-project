    "One reduction step for spectra that we might care about is converting the measured counts in the spectrum into a true **flux** measurement (i.e., ergs per second per square centimeter per angstrom). Often times we do not care about this: most relative measurements don't need an accurate flux measurement from the star. For example, if you are measuring radial velocities of a star to try and detect planets, you don't need to know how much energy is contained in the spectrum, only how the spectrum shifts in the dispersion direction. However, if we're concerned with the amount of energy contained in an emission line, for example, then we need to convert our spectrum to units of flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of ways to do this but we are going to focus on using *flux standards*, or stars with known spectral energy distributions, to derive a flux conversion factor as a function of airmass. If we wanted to be very rigorous with our observations, we would have observed our flux standard many times during the night covering a wide range of airmasses (secz = 1.0 - 2.0). However, given the time-constrained nature of our APO nights we were only able to observe flux standards at a couple of airmasses that were close to those of our objects. This means that our flux calibration will be approximate and likely accurate to ~20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to produce a flux-calibrated spectrum are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Produce 1-D spectra for your science objects and your flux standard, as well as a corresponding wavelength solution for each observation\n",
    "* Re-bin the observed standard onto the coarse wavelength grid of the known flux spectrum\n",
    "* For each airmass, divide the known flux spectrum by the observed and interpolated standard spectrum to produce a flux conversion factor at each airmass\n",
    "* Interpolate the smoothed flux conversion factor onto the observed wavelength grid\n",
    "* Multiply the observed science object spectrum by the flux conversion factor of the matching (or closest) airmass\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! Once you have conversion factors for each observed airmass simply multiply your observed object spectrum by the conversion factor, which has units of counts/flux, and now you have a flux-calibrated spectrum. We will go through these steps in detail below and you will get to practice some plotting and spectrum analysis."
